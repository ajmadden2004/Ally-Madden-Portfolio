# Ally Madden — Technical Portfolio

## 👋 About Me
I’m a Management Information Systems major at the University of Dayton (graduating May 2026) with experience in data governance, analytics, and AI-driven solutions. My work blends technical problem‑solving with clear documentation, process management, and a strong focus on practical, real‑world impact.

I’ve interned in IT Data Governance and Reinsurance Operations at The Cincinnati Insurance Companies, where I worked with SQL, metadata analysis, and cross‑functional collaboration. I’m also a collegiate athlete on the UD Women’s Golf Team, balancing 20–40 hours per week of training with academic excellence.
