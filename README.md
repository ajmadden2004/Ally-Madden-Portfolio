# Ally Madden — Technical Portfolio

## About Me
I’m a Management Information Systems major at the University of Dayton (graduating May 2026) with experience in data governance, analytics, and AI-driven solutions. My work blends technical problem‑solving with clear documentation, process management, and a strong focus on practical, real‑world impact.

I’ve interned in IT Data Governance and Reinsurance Operations at The Cincinnati Insurance Companies, where I worked with SQL, metadata analysis, and cross‑functional collaboration. I’m also a collegiate athlete on the UD Women’s Golf Team, balancing 20–40 hours per week of training with academic excellence.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Capstone Azure GPT Chatbot  
**Repo:** [capstone-azure-gpt-chatbot](https://github.com/ajmadden2004/capstone-azure-gpt-chatbot)  

The Student AI Agent is a university-wide initiative to expand the FlyerGPT platform with a student-facing AI assistant that consolidates essential academic and campus information into one conversational interface. The project integrates four major data sources—Academic Calendar, Course Catalog, Campus Map, and Student Services Directory—using a combination of public web data, SQL-backed authenticated data, and API-driven retrieval. Built within the University of Dayton’s internal AI infrastructure, the agent reduces repetitive inquiries handled by staff and gives students faster, more intuitive access to the information they need. This project demonstrates applied AI agent design, data engineering, and system integration within a real university environment.

**Includes:**  
- Prompt engineering documentation
